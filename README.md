## 🔍 What is Process Hollowing?

Process Hollowing is a sophisticated **evasion technique** widely used by modern malware to:

- Execute malicious code under the guise of legitimate processes
- Evade intrusion detection and prevention systems
- Maintain persistence on compromised systems

> 💡 **In essence**: a legitimate process is created in a suspended state, its memory content is hollowed out, and replaced with malicious code. When the process is resumed, the malicious code runs with the privileges and appearance of the original process.

## ⚠️ For Educational Purposes Only

This repository contains:

- **Detailed explanation** of the Process Hollowing technique
- **Complete source code** for a Proof of Concept (PoC)
- **Bilingual documentation** (English and Spanish)

## 🔧 How It Works

The technique is divided into several critical steps:

1. **Creation**: A legitimate process (like notepad.exe) is created in a suspended state
2. **Disassembly**: The PEB (Process Environment Block) is obtained and disassociated
3. **Hollowing**: The original process memory is freed
4. **Injection**: Malicious code is written into the freed memory space
5. **Reconstruction**: Entry point is reconfigured and context restored
6. **Execution**: The process is resumed, now running the malicious code
